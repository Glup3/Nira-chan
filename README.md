## Config File

You have to develop with your own config file specific to your test server.
If you add/remove/update the config, make sure its the same for every config file.

1. copy `config.json`
2. rename the copy to something temporarily, example: `prod.json`
3. customize `config.json` to your test server
4. start developing

Notes:

- dont commit your custom `config.json`!
- if you mess up, you should still have `prod.json`
- if you REALLY messed up, you still have `config_backup.json`

## ADD MORE CONTENT TBD
